# Customer-Segmentation-Using-KMeans
Customer Segmentation of mall customers dataset from Kaggle using Kmeans algorithm (optimised with greedy method)
Standard Kmeans and Optimised Kmeans are compared for performance, with Optimised Kmeans Algorithm performing better than random initialisation of centroids ,by using Greedy Min-Max method to initialise centroids before clustering the data
